    The sampling distribution of a statistic is the probability distribution of that statistic when we draw many samples from a population.

    st.markdown("""
    ### Key Points:
    1. Sampling distributions can be created for various statistics (e.g., mean, variance, proportion).
    2. The sampling distribution of the mean tends to be normally distributed (Central Limit Theorem).
    3. The spread of the sampling distribution decreases as sample size increases.
    4. Statistical inference techniques are largely based on sampling distributions.

    ### Why is it important?
    - Helps us understand the variability of sample statistics.
    - Forms the basis for inferential statistics and hypothesis testing.
    - Allows us to make probabilistic statements about population parameters.

    **Observations:**
    1. The population distribution is bimodal.
    2. The sampling distribution of means tends towards a normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem).
    3. The mean of sample means is close to the population mean.
    4. The standard deviation of sample means (standard error) is smaller than the population standard deviation.
    5. As you increase the sample size, the sampling distribution becomes narrower.

### Key Takeaways:
1. The sampling distribution shows how a statistic varies across many samples.
2. For means, the sampling distribution tends to be normal, even if the population isn't (Central Limit Theorem).
3. The spread of the sampling distribution decreases as sample size increases.
4. Understanding sampling distributions is crucial for statistical inference and hypothesis testing.
5. The mean of the sampling distribution is an unbiased estimator of the population mean.
