    **Observations:**
    1. The population distribution is bimodal.
    2. The sampling distribution of means tends towards a normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem).
    3. The mean of sample means is close to the population mean.
    4. The standard deviation of sample means (standard error) is smaller than the population standard deviation.
    5. As you increase the sample size, the sampling distribution becomes narrower.
