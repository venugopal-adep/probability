            The expected number of rainy days is calculated by multiplying the number of days by the daily probability of rain.

            In this case: 30 days * 0.3 = 9 days

            Think of it like this: If you flip a coin that lands heads 30% of the time, and you flip it 100 times, you'd expect to get heads about 30 times. Similarly, if it rains 30% of the time, in 30 days, you'd expect about 9 rainy days.

            This violates the assumption of constant probability. In reality, seasons do affect rainfall:

            1. Constant probability (assumption): Imagine a game where you roll a die, and it rains if you roll a 6. The chance is always 1/6, regardless of when you play.

            2. Seasonal changes (reality): It's more like playing different games depending on the season. In the rainy season, you might rain if you roll 4, 5, or 6 (higher chance), while in the dry season, it might only rain on a 6 (lower chance).

            Imagine flipping a coin where heads = rain, tails = no rain. Each flip is independent, so you might get a random mix like:
            HTHTHTHTHT (H = rain, T = no rain)

            Reality (clustered events):
            Rainy days often come together, so you might see a pattern more like:
            HHHHTTTTTHHHHTTTTT

            In the clustered pattern, you're more likely to see longer streaks of both rainy and dry days. This means:
            1. When it rains, it's more likely to keep raining for a while.
            2. When it's dry, it's more likely to stay dry for a longer period.

            So, compared to the binomial model, clustering increases the chances of both long rainy periods and long dry spells. This is why weather forecasts often talk about "rainy seasons" or "dry spells" rather than predicting each day independently.
