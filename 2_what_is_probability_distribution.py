            The Poisson distribution is ideal for modeling the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, 
            especially when these events happen with a known average rate and independently of each other.

            In this case:
            - We're counting discrete events (cars passing)
            - It's over a fixed time interval (one hour)

            - There's likely an average rate of cars per hour

            The Poisson distribution could tell us the probability of seeing any specific number of cars in an hour, 
            given the average rate. This is useful for traffic management, urban planning, and even for businesses

            <h4>Explanation:</h4>
            For a continuous probability distribution, the area under the curve of the probability density function (PDF) 
            always equals 1. This is a fundamental property of PDFs.

            Here's why this makes sense:
            1. Probabilities must always be between 0 and 1.
            2. The PDF covers all possible outcomes for the random variable.
            3. The total probability of all possible outcomes must sum to 1 (or 100%).

            Think of it like this: Imagine you're measuring people's heights. The PDF might show that some heights 
            are more likely than others, but if you consider every possible height (from very short to very tall), 
            the probability of someone falling somewhere on this spectrum is 100% or 1.

            This property is crucial for calculations involving continuous distributions, such as finding probabilities 
            for ranges of values (which is done by calculating the area under the curve for that range).

            <h4>Explanation:</h4>
            In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. 
            This is often called the "68-95-99.7 rule" or the "empirical rule."

            Here's a breakdown:
            - About 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
            - About 95% falls within 2 standard deviations
            - About 99.7% falls within 3 standard deviations

            This property makes the normal distribution incredibly useful in many fields:

            - In quality control, it helps determine acceptable ranges for products.
            - In psychology, it's used to standardize test scores (like IQ tests).
            - In finance, it's used in risk assessment and portfolio management.

            For example, if human height is normally distributed with a mean of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm:
            - About 68% of people would be between 160 cm and 180 cm tall
            - About 95% would be between 150 cm and 190 cm
            - Almost everyone (99.7%) would be between 140 cm and 200 cm

            This "clustering" around the mean is what gives the normal distribution its characteristic bell shape!
