    st.markdown("""
    Mathematical notation is a symbolic language used to represent mathematical concepts. It includes symbols for numbers, operations, functions, and relationships, helping us express complex ideas concisely.
    
    ### Basic Notations:
    1. **Numbers**: 
       - Natural numbers: $\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$
       - Integers: $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{\\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$
       - Real numbers: $\\mathbb{R}$
    2. **Operations**:
       - Addition: $a + b$
       - Subtraction: $a - b$
       - Multiplication: $a \\cdot b$ or $ab$
       - Division: $\\frac{a}{b}$
    3. **Sets and Relations**:
       - Set notation: $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$
       - Belongs to: $2 \\in A$
       - Does not belong to: $5 \\notin A$
       - Subset: $B \\subseteq A$
    4. **Common Symbols**:
       - $\\forall$: For all
       - $\\exists$: There exists
       - $\\Rightarrow$: Implies
       - $\\Leftrightarrow$: If and only if

    st.markdown("""
    **Propositional logic** is a branch of logic that deals with statements that are either true or false. These statements, called **propositions**, are connected using logical connectives like AND, OR, and NOT.

    ### Basic Components:
    1. **Propositions**: Statements that can be true or false. Examples:
       - $p$: "It is raining."
       - $q$: "I have an umbrella."
    2. **Logical Connectives**:
       - **AND** ($\\land$): True if both propositions are true. Example: $p \\land q$ ("It is raining AND I have an umbrella").
       - **OR** ($\\lor$): True if at least one proposition is true. Example: $p \\lor q$ ("It is raining OR I have an umbrella").
       - **NOT** ($\\neg$): Inverts the truth value of a proposition. Example: $\\neg p$ ("It is NOT raining").
       - **Implication** ($\\rightarrow$): $p \\rightarrow q$ means "If $p$ is true, then $q$ is true".

# Tab 3: Predicate Logic

    st.markdown("""
    **Predicate logic** extends propositional logic by dealing with predicates and quantifiers. A **predicate** is a statement that contains variables and becomes a proposition when the variables are given specific values.

    ### Basic Components:
    1. **Predicates**: Functions that return true or false. Example: $P(x)$ can represent "$x$ is greater than 5".
    2. **Quantifiers**:
       - **Universal Quantifier** ($\\forall$): Indicates that a statement applies to all elements in a set. Example: $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N}, x + 1 > x$ ("For all natural numbers $x$, $x + 1$ is greater than $x$").
       - **Existential Quantifier** ($\\exists$): Indicates that there exists at least one element in a set for which the statement is true. Example: $\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{R}, x^2 = 4$ ("There exists a real number $x$ such that $x^2 = 4$").

    ### Example: Prime Numbers
    Let's use predicate logic to express "All prime numbers greater than 2 are odd."
    - Predicate: $P(x)$ = "$x$ is prime."
    - Statement: $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N}, (P(x) \\land x > 2) \\rightarrow \\text{Odd}(x)$
