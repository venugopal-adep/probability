    Graph Theory in Statistics is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. 
    A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). 
    In statistics, graph theory is often applied to network analysis, studying relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, or other entities.
