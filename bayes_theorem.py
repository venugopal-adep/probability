## Understanding Bayes' Theorem
Bayesâ€™ theorem allows us to update our predictions or beliefs based on new information. It calculates the likelihood of an event occurring given prior knowledge or probability.

**General Formula**:
""")

# Displaying the general Bayes' theorem formula
st.latex(r'''P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}''')

Where:
- **P(A | B)**: Probability of event A occurring given that B is true (Posterior Probability)
- **P(B | A)**: Probability of event B occurring given that A is true (Likelihood)
- **P(A)**: Probability of event A occurring (Prior)
- **P(B)**: Probability of event B occurring (Evidence)

Let's explore some specific use cases using this formula.
