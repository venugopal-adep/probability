# Quiz Question 1
q1 = st.radio(
    "1. If you survey 10 adults and the probability of an adult having posted a TikTok video is 0.5, "
    "what's the expected number of adults who have posted a video?",
    ('3', '5', '7', '10')
)

if st.button('Check Answer for Question 1'):
    if q1 == '5':
        st.success("Correct! The expected value is n * p = 10 * 0.5 = 5.")
    else:
        st.error("That's not correct. The expected value is n * p = 10 * 0.5 = 5.")
    
    st.write("""
    Explanation: In a Binomial Distribution, the expected value (average outcome) is calculated by 
    multiplying the number of trials (n) by the probability of success (p). In this case, 
    n = 10 and p = 0.5, so the expected value is 10 * 0.5 = 5.
    
    This means that if you repeated this survey many times, on average, you'd expect 5 out of 10 
    adults to have posted a TikTok video. It's like flipping a fair coin 10 times - you'd expect 
    about 5 heads on average.

# Quiz Question 2

    Explanation: Let's break it down:
    - Probability of exactly 2 successes: {:.4f}
    - Probability of exactly 5 successes: {:.4f}
    - Probability of exactly 8 successes: {:.4f}

    The expected value is np = 15 * 0.2 = 3, so outcomes closer to this are more likely. 
    That's why 2 is the most probable outcome among the given options.

    Think of it like this: If you had a bag with 80 red marbles and 20 blue marbles, and you 
    drew 15 marbles, you'd expect to get about 3 blue marbles. Getting 2 blue marbles is closer 
    to this expectation than getting 5 or 8.

# Quiz Question 3

    "how does the shape of the Binomial Distribution change?",

    else:
        st.error("That's not correct. The distribution becomes more spread out and shifts to the right.")
    
    st.write("""
    Explanation: When the probability (p) increases:
    1. The distribution shifts to the right because the expected value (np) increases. 
       This means we expect more successes on average.
    2. The distribution becomes more spread out because the variance (np(1-p)) increases 
       when p moves from 0.3 towards 0.5.

    Imagine you're throwing darts at a target. If you become twice as likely to hit the bullseye:
    - You'd expect to hit more bullseyes overall (shift to the right)
    - There'd be more variability in your possible scores (more spread out)

    Let's visualize this change:
