<h2>What is a Random Variable?</h2>
<p>A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of an experiment. It assumes different values with different probabilities. It is usually denoted by a capital letter X and the probability associated with any particular value of X is denoted by P(X=x).</p>

        **Explanation:**
        - The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials.
        - In this case, each employee has an independent chance of being promoted.
        - The shape of the distribution depends on the number of employees and the promotion rate.
        - A higher promotion rate will shift the peak to the right, while a lower rate will shift it to the left.
        - The width of the distribution (spread) increases with the number of employees.

        **Explanation:**
        - The normal distribution is often used to model continuous variables like speed.
        - It's symmetric around the mean, with about 68% of values within one standard deviation of the mean.
        - The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation affects its spread.
        - A larger standard deviation results in a wider, flatter distribution.
        - The probability of a speed falling in any specific range can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF).
