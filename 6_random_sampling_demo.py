    ### Key Advantages:
    1. **Unbiased**: Each member of the population has an equal probability of selection.
    2. **Representative**: The sample is likely to reflect the characteristics of the entire population.
    3. **Simplicity**: It's straightforward to implement and understand.
    4. **Statistical Validity**: Many statistical methods assume random sampling.
    
    ### Limitations:
    1. Requires a complete list of the population, which may not always be available.
    2. Can be impractical for very large populations.
    3. May not capture specific subgroups in small samples of diverse populations.

    - Red dots represent the randomly selected sample.

### Key Takeaways:
1. Simple Random Sampling gives every item in the population an equal chance of selection.
2. It helps in obtaining a representative sample of the population.
3. The larger the sample size, the more likely it is to reflect the characteristics of the population.
4. While simple and unbiased, it may not always be practical for very large or complex populations.
