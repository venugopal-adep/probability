    Suppose we are sampling from a population with mean Œº and standard deviation œÉ. 
    Let XÃÑ be the random variable representing the sample mean of n independent observations.
    """)
    
    st.markdown("""
    ### Key Properties:
    1. The mean of XÃÑ is equal to Œº (population mean)
    2. The standard deviation of XÃÑ is equal to œÉ/‚àön (Also called the 'standard error' of XÃÑ)
    3. Even if the population is not normally distributed, for sufficiently large n, XÃÑ is approximately normally distributed (Central Limit Theorem)

    ### Why are these properties important?
    - They allow us to make inferences about the population based on sample statistics.
    - They form the basis for many statistical tests and confidence interval calculations.
    - They help us understand the relationship between sample size and the precision of our estimates.

    **Observations:**
    1. The population distribution is not normal (it's exponential in this case).
    2. The sampling distribution of means tends towards a normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem).
    3. The mean of sample means is close to the population mean (Œº).
    4. The standard deviation of sample means (standard error) is close to œÉ/‚àön.
    5. As you increase the sample size (n), the sampling distribution becomes narrower and more normal.
    6. The normality test p-value increases with larger sample sizes, indicating closer approximation to normal distribution.

### Key Takeaways:
1. The mean of the sampling distribution of the mean (XÃÑ) is equal to the population mean (Œº).
2. The standard deviation of XÃÑ (standard error) is œÉ/‚àön, where œÉ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.
3. As sample size increases, the standard error decreases, leading to more precise estimates.
4. The Central Limit Theorem states that for sufficiently large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the population distribution.
5. These properties are fundamental to statistical inference, allowing us to make conclusions about populations based on sample data.
