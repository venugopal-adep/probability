    Solution:
    1. Calculate z-scores for 85 and 115:
       z‚ÇÅ = (85 - 100) / 15 = -1
       z‚ÇÇ = (115 - 100) / 15 = 1
    
    2. Use the standard normal distribution table or calculator:
       P(-1 < Z < 1) = 0.6826
    
    3. Convert to percentage: 0.6826 * 100 = 68.26%
    
    Therefore, approximately 68.26% of people have an IQ between 85 and 115.

    Question: What is the probability that a randomly selected adult male is taller than 184 cm?
    
    Solution:
    1. Calculate the z-score for 184 cm:
       z = (184 - 170) / 7 = 2
    
    2. We want P(X > 184), which is equivalent to P(Z > 2)
    
    3. Using a standard normal table or calculator:
       P(Z > 2) = 1 - P(Z < 2) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228
    
    4. Convert to percentage: 0.0228 * 100 = 2.28%
    
    Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected adult male is taller than 184 cm is approximately 2.28%.
