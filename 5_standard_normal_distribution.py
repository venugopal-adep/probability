    ### Key Concepts
    
    1. **Standard Normal Distribution (Z-distribution):**
       - Always has a mean (Î¼) of 0 and standard deviation (Ïƒ) of 1
       - Used to compare different normal distributions
    
    2. **Standardization:**
       - Process of converting a normal distribution to a standard normal distribution
       - Formula: Z = (X - Î¼) / Ïƒ
         Where X is the original value, Î¼ is the mean, and Ïƒ is the standard deviation
    
    3. **Interpretation:**
       - Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean
       - Positive Z-score: value is above the mean
       - Negative Z-score: value is below the mean
    
    Try adjusting the sliders to see how changes in Î¼ and Ïƒ affect the original distribution and its standardized form!

    Question: What is the Z-score for an IQ of 130?
    
    Solution:
    1. Use the standardization formula: Z = (X - Î¼) / Ïƒ
    2. Z = (130 - 100) / 15 = 2

    Question: Which student performed better relative to their class?
    
    Solution:
    1. Calculate Z-scores for both students:
       Student A: Z = (85 - 75) / 8 = 1.25
       Student B: Z = (92 - 80) / 10 = 1.2
    
    2. Compare Z-scores:
       Student A's Z-score (1.25) is slightly higher than Student B's (1.2)
    
    Interpretation: Student A performed slightly better relative to their class, as their score was 1.25 standard deviations above their class mean, while Student B's score was 1.2 standard deviations above their class mean.
